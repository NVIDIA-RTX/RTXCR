# RTX Character Rendering Sample User Guide

![banner](figures/UserGuide/UserGuide.png)

The RTX Character Rendering Sample provides an example of using the RTX Character Rendering libraries for hair and skin. It also provides a GUI to easily interact with the sample, including changing materials in real-time to demonstrate rendering details for skin and hair.

The GUI can be opened or closed using the `ESC` key on the keyboard.

### DLFG

DLFG (DLSS Frame Generation) is supported in our sample on RTX 40 and 50 series GPUs.  
- `RTX 40 series`: Supports single-frame generation.  
- `RTX 50 series`: Supports up to 3 generated frames (4Ã— DLFG) for higher frame rates.

### Reflex

Reflex is supported in our sample to reduce system latency and improve responsiveness.
- `Low Latency`: Minimizes input lag by syncing CPU and GPU work.
- `Low Latency + Boost`: Includes Low Latency plus keeps GPU at high clocks to avoid slowdowns when CPU-limited.

## Path Tracing

|         Name       |   Description   |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|    Enable Random   |   Enable random light and BSDF sampling   |
|    Bounces   |   Maximum number of bounces allowed for each path    |
|    Exposure Adjustment   |   Post-processing exposure adjustment   |
|    Debug Output   |   Show Debug Views    |

## Denoiser

Denoiser selection: we currently support DLSS-RR, NRD, and reference mode.

DLSS-RR has following 5 quality modes:
- `DLAA`: Full-screen denoiser. Ultimate Quality.
- `Quality`: Best quality with some performance cost.
- `Balance`: Best balance mode between quality and performance.
- `Performance`: Better performance, could have minor artifacts or blurries.
- `UltraPerformance`: Best performance, but could cause significant artifacts and blurries.

We also provide NRD as an alternative denoiser, compatible with any ray tracing-capable GPU. For more details, check the [NRD Guide]

### Upscaler

Upscaler Selection: When using NRD or disabling the denoiser, we currently support DLSS-SR and TAA as upscalers.

Similar to DLSS-RR, DLSS-SR also has 5 quality modes:
- `DLAA`: Full-screen denoiser. Ultimate Quality.
- `Quality`: Best quality with some performance cost.
- `Balance`: Best balance mode between quality and performance.
- `Performance`: Better performance, could have minor artifacts or blurries.
- `UltraPerformance`: Best performance, but could cause significant artifacts and blurries.

## Lighting

|         Name       |   Description   |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|    Enable Sky  |   Enable skybox   |
|    Sky Type  |   Constant/Procedural/EnvironmentMap   |
|    Environment Map  |   Choose the environment map from assets folder    |
|    Environment Light Intensity |   The scalar for environment map lighting    |
|    Enable Emissives  |   Enable the emissive surfaces    |
|    Show Emissive Surfaces  |    Show the emissive surfaces. If disabled, the emissives will still be calculated, but the surfaces will be invisible   |
|    Enable Lighting  |    Enable/Disable all lights   |
|    Enable Direct Lighting  |    Enable the direct lighting   |
|    Enable Indirect Lighting  |    Enable the indirect lighting   |

## Hair

See explanations of parameters in [RTX Character Rendering Hair Guide], Step 2.

To use the GUI parameters, tick "Enable Hair Material Override".

## Subsurface Scattering

See explanations of parameters in [RTX Character Rendering SSS Guide], Step 2.

To use the GUI parameters, tick "Enable Hair Material Override".

## Animation

| Name | Description |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Enable Animation | Globally enable animation. |
| Speed | Animation playback speed, in seconds per frame. |
| Enable Animation Smoothing | Smooth the transition of the last frame to avoid sudden jumps back to the first frame. |
| Smoothing Factor | Controls the amount of smoothing applied to the animation. |
| Enable Animation Debugging | Enable debugging for animation playback. |
| Animation Keyframe Index Override | Render the animation at a specific keyframe index. |
| Animation Keyframe Weight Override | Render the animation between keyframe N and N+1 with a specific interpolation weight. |

## Tone mapping

|         Name       |   Description   |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|    Operator  |   Tonemapping operator, support Reinhard and Linear   |
|    Clamp  |   Clamp final output color to 0-1  |

## Cmdline Options

### Generic
- `-d3d12` or `-dx12`: Use DirectX 12 as the graphics API (default). DirectX 11 is not supported in this sample.
